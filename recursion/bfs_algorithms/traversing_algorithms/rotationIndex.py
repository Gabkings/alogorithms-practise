# this problem is from
# https://www.interviewcake.com/question/python/find-rotation-point
#

# I want to learn some big words so people think I'm smart.

# I opened up a dictionary to a page in the middle and started flipping
# through, looking for words I didn't know. I put each word I didn't know
# at increasing indices in a huge list I created in memory. When I reached
# the end of the dictionary, I started from the beginning and did the same
# thing until I reached the page I started at.

# Now I have a list of words that are mostly alphabetical, except they
# start somewhere in the middle of the alphabet, reach the end, and then
# start from the beginning of the alphabet. In other words, this is an
# alphabetically ordered list that has been "rotated." For example:

words = [
    'pto',
    'ret',
    'sup',
    'und',
    'xen',
    'asy',  # <-- rotates here!
    'bab',
    'ban',
    'eng',
    'kar',
    'oth',
]

# Write a function for finding the index of the "rotation point,"
# which is where I started working from the beginning of the
# dictionary. This list is huge (there are lots of words I don't know) so
# we want to be efficient here.
